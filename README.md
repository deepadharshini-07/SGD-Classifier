# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import required libraries.

2.Load the Iris dataset.

3.Convert it into a DataFrame.

4.Split data into X (features) and y (target).

5.Split into training and testing sets.

6.Create an SGD Classifier.

7.Train the model.

8.Make predictions.

9.Check accuracy.

10.Show confusion matrix.
